      "content": "Letâ€™s introduce a new sensor to measure an ambient light level.  A\nphotoresistor (aka light dependent resistor or LDR) would do a great job of\nmeasuring the parameter. However, there is a small problem: we do not have a\nphotoresistor node in XOD.\n\nYet, we have basic nodes for working with the digital and analog ports of the Arduino. A photoresistor is a pretty primitive device, and all we need to do is read its value from the analog port on the Arduino. To do so, we will use an `analog-sensor` node.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Assemble the [circuit with LDR and LED](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/17-ldr/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial_17).\n\n2. Find the `analog-sensor` node in `xod/common-hardware` and add it to the patch.\n\n3. Read the description of the node on the help page. Pay attention to the range of values the node returns.\n\n4. Link the `VAL` output pin of the `analog-input` node to the `LUM` pin of the led node.\n\n5. Upload the patch to the Arduino.\n\nCover the photoresistor with your hand, and watch how the brightness of the LED changes.",
