You can do it with the `PORT` pin.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Reconnect the LED to digital port 10 on Arduino ([scheme](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/05-wiring/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial_05)).\n2. Change the `PORT` pin value to D10 and the `LUM` value to 1.\n3. Upload your patch to the Arduino.\n\nThe LED should turn on at Arduino's port 10.\n",
